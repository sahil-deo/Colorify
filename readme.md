# Hue Blind

This API converts normal colors into their simulated appearance for the three major types of color blindness:

- **Protanopia** (red-blind)
- **Deuteranopia** (green-blind)
- **Tritanopia** (blue-blind)

Itâ€™s built in **Go** and deployed for public use.

## API Usage

### Endpoint
```

GET [https://blind-hue.onrender.com/api?color=](https://blind-hue.onrender.com/api?color=)<hex>\&color=<hex>...

```

> **Note:** When using raw URLs in a browser or directly in the address bar, replace `#` with `%23` (e.g., `%23FF0000`). Most HTTP libraries in JavaScript (fetch/axios) or Python (requests) handle this encoding automatically.

### Query Parameters
- `color` â€” One or more hex colors (e.g. `#FF0000`).  
  You can provide multiple values by repeating the parameter.
